In this notebook, you will find historical Canadian Dollar-Yen exchange rate futures data and a time series analysis and modeling used to determine whether there is any predictable behavior and identify any potential opportunities. 


### CAD-JPY Price 

![CAD-JPY Price Plot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96010215/157240920-4991c29a-c4aa-4be9-8d83-caa5b6e00dc6.png)

historically you can see that in times of global financial crisis the exchange rate is shorty followed by a agressive fall to the downside. In more recent years the volitility has consolidated, setting a range of around $75-$90, but continuing to follow its downtrend. 

### Exchange Rate vs Trend 2015 - Present

Long term the exchange rate appears to be continueing its downtrend after hitting a bottom of around $75 back in the 3rd quarter of 2016 and now again om the 1st quarter 2020, the exchange appears to be creating lower lows over this set period. Short term the price looks to be bouncing to he up side but if the historical data is used as an indicator, the price should hit some resistance aroun the 80-$85 range.

### Time Series Conclusion 

Based on my findings I would not be looking to purchase the Yen now due to my time series analysis represents increasing volitility for the yen's value and is forcasted to expreience downward movement over the short term, aligning with its long term trend.
